# Student Attendance Monitoring System - Doctor App
- Graduation Project 
# Introduction
- The Student Attendance Monitoring System - Doctor App is designed to help the Faculty of Physical Therapy at October 6 University manage academic content for students and doctors. This app allows doctors to track student attendance in lectures or sections and facilitates communication between students, physicians, and assistants through real-time announcements.

# Features
- Immediate display of announcements with title, body, and timestamp.
- QR code generation with customizable duration (1min, 2min, 5min).
- Doctor's profile information (name, email, image, etc.).
- Settings menu for customization.

# Backend - Firebase

- This app utilizes Firebase as its backend to provide real-time data storage and communication features. Firebase offers a secure and scalable platform for managing user data, announcements, and more. Here's how Firebase is integrated into the app:

- Real-time Data: Firebase Realtime Database is used to store and retrieve announcements, attendance records, and user data in real-time, ensuring that users receive the most up-to-date information.

- Authentication: Firebase Authentication is employed to manage user accounts securely. The university's IT department creates and manages user accounts, and Firebase Authentication ensures a reliable login and authentication process.

- Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage can be used to store images and other assets associated with user profiles and announcements.
